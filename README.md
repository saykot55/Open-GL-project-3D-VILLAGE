This OpenGL program visualizes a scenic environment containing the following elements:

Features:
Sun:

A golden yellow circular sun is positioned in the sky using a custom-drawn elliptical polygon.
Clouds:

White, fluffy clouds are composed of multiple overlapping ellipses.
They rotate, scale, and translate dynamically based on keyboard input.
Boat:

A black-and-brown boat with a rotating purple sail is animated to move smoothly across the scene.
The boat resets its position after moving out of the view.
Ground and River:

A green ground covers the lower part of the scene.
A blue river flows diagonally across the landscape, adding a dynamic layer.
Hills:

Triangular brown and golden hills add depth and visual interest to the background.
Houses:

Two detailed 3D houses with colorful roofs, doors, and windows enhance the realism.
One house includes a door and a chimney-like structure for added detail.
Tree:

A tree with a brown trunk and green leafy canopy is present near the houses.
Interactivity:
Keyboard Controls:
r / l: Rotate clouds clockwise or counterclockwise.
s / d: Scale clouds up or down.
t: Translate clouds horizontally.
Dynamic Animation:
The boat moves continuously from right to left.
The sail rotates slightly, simulating wind movement.
The clouds' position, scale, and rotation can be adjusted in real time.
